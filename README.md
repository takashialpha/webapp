# core-shell

**A fast, POSIX-like shell written in Rust.**


## Features

- Interactive shell with line editing
- Builtin command support
- `-c` for one-shot commands
- Script execution from file
- Flags: `--version`, `--license`, `--help`
- Clean and fast parser
- Meant to be lightweight enough for `/bin/sh`


## Usage

```sh
core-shell [OPTIONS] [SCRIPT]
```

### Arguments:
- `[SCRIPT]` — Path to a shell script to execute

### Options:
- `-c, --command <command>` — Run a single command and exit (e.g. `-c "echo hello"`)
- `--license` — Displays license information
- `-h, --help` — Print help
- `-V, --version` — Print version


## Installation

### Build (release mode)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/core-shell
cd core-shell
cargo build --release
```

### Install to `/bin` or as `/bin/sh`

```sh
sudo cp target/release/core-shell /bin/core-shell
sudo ln -sf /bin/core-shell /bin/sh - this part sets the core-shell as your sh
```

> ⚠️ Warning: replacing `/bin/sh` can be dangerous if you dont know what you're doing, make sure to test the shell before using it as your sh.
> Bugs can be found as the project is in constant development.
